				But first, some backstory. The reason I advocate for deep sea exploration is quite special. You see, as a kid, I was horrified about the thought of going underwater. I used to cry, even when I wasn't even in any real danger at all. There was a time, where I was crying, screaming, and bawling... because I was being forced to go down a water slide. That wasn't even that tall. 
				<br>
				The ocean and sea to me is like a newfound friend who I used to fight with. Once I learnt how to swim (I was forced, mind you), I couldn't stop. The feeling of just going underwater and kicking your feet, the feeling of just swimming from one end of the pool to another, I loved it. I fell in love with water.  And I wanted to learn more about it.
				<br>
		 		I'm sure a lot of other people also feel the same. They wish to know what lies deep under the sea. And I want to set your flame of curiosity alight. Join me! We shall explore the ocean together, see what lies in the dark, and get to know the ocean better. Join us, for a bright adventure in the place wherein light fades, the deep sea!!!....
