	 		We have always been fascinated by  the ocean. So mysterious, so beautiful. So calm, yet can be so deadly. Because of this fascination,  we have found ways to explore it. Though for many many years, it was thought that it was impossible to be able to reach the depth that we are able to go to now with our current submarines. In fact, Ferdinand Magellan himself said that the ocean was "immeasurably deep" ("Human exploration of the deep ocean," n.d.). 
	 		<br>
	 		<br>
			The deep sea is defined as the point where light starts to dwindle, around 200 meters (NOAA Ocean Exploration, n.d.). It is a pretty cool place where the sea creatures start becoming way different from what we are used to in shallow water. The exploration of this part and below is called "Deep sea exploration" and we have explored quite a bit of the deep sea. Keyword, "a bit". All in all, we have only explored 5% of the ocean (Fava, 2022). There are still so many new things to learn, new things to chart.
			<br>
			<br>
			Deep sea exploration has drastically improved. We used to use sphere like submersibles called bathyspheres (Encyclopedia Britannica, n.d.). To submarines that can go down up to thousands of meters!! But do not be fooled, there is still room for improvement. And for that, we will need all the help and supporters that we can gather.
